To get started, follow these steps:

## System requirements

1. Make sure you have pyqt5 installed on your system. Assuming you already have python installed, you can install pyqt5 by running the command: "pip install PyQt5".

2. Once you have pyqt5 installed, open the command prompt and run the command "python3 app.py" to start the game.

## Game instructions

3. The game selection window will appear, allowing you to choose which game you want to play. Lets start with Match Tiles Game.

4. Choose the Match Tiles game button, a new window will open, revealing 16 tiles for one second before they turn black and become face-down. You'll have only 45 seconds to match all the tiles.

5. Each correct match you make will increase your score by 10 points, and the tiles will turn white to indicate they have disappeared.

6.  If you successfully match all the tiles within the time limit, your final score will be 80 plus the remaining time. You'll then be prompted to add your initials to the scoreboard.

7. Exit the window and return to the main window

8. Let's now try playing Columns!

9. Once you've selected "Columns," a game window will appear and the timer will start. You'll have up to 4 minutes to play the game, unless you run out of space before the time runs out.

10. On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the next set of colored blocks. Choose a column where you want to place the set of blocks.

11. If you can match three colors vertically or horizontally, the set of matched colors will disappear and the remaining blocks will drop down. You'll earn 150 points for each matched set.

12. If you still have space when the timer runs out, you can enter your initials to write to the scoreboard.

13. To check the scoreboard, head to the main window, and select the scoreboard you wish to view. The scoreboards showcase the top ten scores.
